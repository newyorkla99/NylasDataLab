## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#1
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
athleteevents <- read_csv("athlete_events.csv")
View(athleteevents)
distinct(athlete_events)
print(athlete_events)
```

#2
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
seasons<- athlete_events %>% group_by(Season) %>% count(Season, sort = TRUE)
print(seasons)
ggplot(athlete_events, aes(x=Season)) + geom_bar(fill="blue")
```

#3
```{r}
playerz<- athlete_events %>% group_by(Name,Season) %>% count(Season, sort = TRUE)
print(playerz)
seasonalplayerz<- playerz%>% group_by(Season) %>% count(Season, sort = TRUE)
print(seasonalplayerz)
ggplot(playerz, aes(x=Season)) + geom_bar(fill="green")
```

#4
```{r}
snowyplayerz<-athlete_events %>% filter(Season== "Winter")
winterplayers<- snowyplayerz %>% distinct(Name, NOC) %>% group_by(NOC) %>% summarise(uniqueplayers=n()) %>% arrange(desc(uniqueplayers))
print(winterplayers)
chosenplayers<- head(winterplayers,10)
print(chosenplayers)
ggplot(chosenplayers, aes(x=NOC)) + geom_bar(fill="pink")

```

#5
```{r}
swedish<- athlete_events %>% filter(NOC %in% c("SWE", "USA"))
print(swedish)
weightsATHLETES<-distinct(Year, Season, Name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% group_by(NOC) %>% summarise(averages=mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
print(weightsATHLETES)
```
